When creating tasks and other roles for use in Ansible please create then 
using the YAML dictionary format. 

Example YAML dictionary format:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: The name of the tasks
      module_name:
        thing1: "some-stuff"
        thing2: "some-other-stuff"
      tags:
        - some-tag
        - some-other-tag


Example **not** in YAML dictionary format:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: The name of the tasks
      module_name: thing1="some-stuff" thing2="some-other-stuff"
      tags:
        - some-tag
        - some-other-tag


Usage of the ">" and "|" operators should be limited to Ansible conditionals 
and command modules such as the ansible ``shell`` module.
